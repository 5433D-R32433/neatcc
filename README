NEATCC
======

neatcc is a simple ARM/x86 C compiler.  I wrote it to complete my
development toolchain (see http://litcave.berlios.de/):

* cc:	git://repo.or.cz/neatcc.git
* ld:	git://repo.or.cz/ld.git
* as:	git://repo.or.cz/neatas.git
* libc:	git://repo.or.cz/neatlibc.git
* gdb:	http://litcave.berlios.de/coredump.tar.gz
  	http://litcave.berlios.de/elfloc.tar.gz

neatcc supports a large subset of C language but lacks some of the
features that I didn't use much myself.  The most important missing
features are struct bitfields, inline asms and floating point and
long long types.

USAGE
=====

neatcc has been tested with neatlibc and dietlibc.  It can compile
itself and neat* toolchain.  The included neatcc script could be
used to invoke ncc with neatlibc library.
